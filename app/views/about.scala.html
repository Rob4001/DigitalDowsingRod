	<h1>What is Digital Dowsing Rod?</h1>
	<p>Digital Dowsing Rod is a tool to help people begin to see the possible impact that renewables can have on their lives through an easy and quick evaluation of the average conditions around their entered position.</p>
	<p>The tool is also a way to make people aware of the energy situation around them in a passive way. As they explore their own situation, they are also presented with the average consumption rates of their surroundings and the cost benefits of renewables in general.</p>
	
	
	<h2>About The Creators</h2>
	<p>Digital Dowsing Rod was created by a team consisting of computer science students, a geologist, and a networking student at the 2nd of Glasgow City Council's Future City Hacks, addressing the theme of Energy in the city.</p>
